# **Hybrid Routing for the IoT**
## challenges & opportunities

^ 
- AW1: existing; either proactive || reactive 
- new technologies & Use Cases @ IoT have emerged
- with them: new network characteristic
- *example:* Lighting system: central control (proactive); connection between sofa lamp & switch if person is in room (reactive)

---
#       **proactive**         **reactive**
###     

![original](./../images/hybrid_venn.pdf)

^ 
- bring p&a together in hybrid prots this sem 
- -> adapt to changes @ network characteristics
- comes with own set of challenges:
	* when/where to switch
	* coordinate 2 fundamentally different routing approaches
	* most research stems from time where IoT vision didnt exist -> necessary to adjust & advance

# **Quick history lesson** 
TODO: insert pictures of 2000 vs 2014 hardware/visions for mobile nodes here

^
- ZRP etc: 2006 or earlier
- research has stalled since them
- failure or too early? -> too early.

---
# **The time is now** 

^research is 10 years old, BUT!! 
- now we have the building blocks in place
- let's take the old ideas and translate them to 2014+

# **Some fancy headline which introduces that I'm going to talk about concepts now** 
^
- I'm not going to bore you with lists of outdated protocols
- instead, i'm going to talk about concepts that they introduce and use some of them as examples
- comprehensive list can be found at TODO

---
# **Scope** 
TODO: sketch route-centered vs area-centered

^TODO: speaker notes that explain both approaches & give protocol examples


---
# **For example...** 
TODO: better headline

TODO: sketch route-centered vs area-centered, translated into application scnerario example

^TODO: speaker notes that explain both examples

---
# **Protocol vs Framework** 
TODO: content

^TODO: speaker notes

---
# **But what about the IoT?** 
TODO: okay cool, and what's suitable for the IoT now? how do we translate this to the 21st century?
