\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}
%==============================================================================
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. \todo{TODO! (where do I put this?)}
The goal of this paper is thus to explore how hybrid routing can be advanced with the \gls{IoT} in mind, building on the foundation which research on \gls{MANET} routing of the past 15 years has built.\todo{find a place for this}\\ 

\subsection{What is the Internet of Things?}
\label{subsec:IoT}
%==============================================================================
The \gls{IoT} envisions autonomous communication between tiny computers installed in everyday objects such as furniture, toys, clothing, or tools with the goal of making them smarter and improving their user experience. IoT devices typically are very constrained devices with no constant power supply. Therefor, they need to be resourceful in terms of computation, storage, RAM and energy usage.
To communicate amongst each other, IoT nodes form spontaneous, wireless mesh networks.
The vision of the Internet of Things is rapidly becoming reality, and with its rise, new demands for routing protocols that serve these kinds of mesh networks surface which cannot be optimally served by either reactive or proactive routing protocols alone.\\
One example for this may be the lighting system in a smart home: Each lamp needs to maintain a stable connection to the control center of the house, forming a tree-like topology towards the sink node that is the central control. In addition to this, lamps may want to communicate spontaneously between each other, for example to create optimal lighting in the study when homeowners sit down at their desk.

\subsection{What is Hybrid Routing?}
\label{subsec:hybrid}
%==============================================================================
Hybrid Routing protocols combine two central routing paradigms into one protocol: Reactive and proactive routing. While reactive protocols stay idle until a route is needed and then \emph{react} to this demand, proactive protocols constantly monitor their network for peers and link qualities, (re-)calculating routes as they gather new data. The former class of protocols perform well in sparse, very mobile networks and save energy by generating less control overhead. The latter are best suited for networks with high demands in terms of throughput, reliability and latency.\\
Hybrid routing protocols aim to adjust their routing strategy from proactive to reactive and back depending on the circumstances: Routes or areas that are deemed important or see a lot of traffic require proactive attention, while sparsely, less important or very mobile areas or routes are best served reactively.\\
In th example of section \ref{subsec:IoT}, all lamps would maintain a proactive route towards the control center, while inter-lamp communication may be set up reactively.

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related_work}
%==============================================================================
\todo{Talk about the past, mostly. talk about areas of research we can steal from.
briefly mention experimental work, esp emmanuels, reference \ref{subsec:experiments}.}

Most research on hybrid routing protocols stems from an era where wireless mesh routing was at its very beginning. This meant that the building blocks for hybrid routing, namely proactive and reactive routing protocols, were under construction themselves, and while proactive and reactive protocols were developed and examined, research in hybrid routing stalled. 

This has since changed: The \gls{IETF} has standardized \gls{OLSR}, OLSRv2  and \gls{AODV}, AODVv2 is on its way to become a standard, and \gls{LOADng} has been deployed in large-scale energy grid networks (TODO: quelle). The body of experience with both reactive and proactive protocols has grown, and research towards hybrid protocols has begun to blossom \ref{baccelli_p2p_prl}\\

But while this milestone has been reached, the amount of protocols of any kind specifically targeted at IoT-like environments is very small. By the time of this writing, the \gls{RPL} is the only dedicated IoT protocol available, and it cannot cover the entire diverse set of requirements that can be found under the umbrella term of ``Internet of Things''. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate protocols designed for environments that share some characteristics with the Internet of Things and may be customized to be a good fit, such as \glspl{DTN}, \glspl{MANET} and, to a certain extent, \glspl{VANET}.\\

\section{Key aspects of Hybrid Routing Protocols}
\label{sec:key_aspects}
%==============================================================================
The protocols discussed in section \ref{sec:related_work} share common approaches, some of which fundamentally shape the way a routing protocol sees and serves a network. The goal of this section is to identify these key aspects and discuss them with regard to the requirements of IoT environment.

\subsection{Scope}
\label{subsec:scope}

Hybrid protocols differ in the way they prioritize routes and decide which of them should be maintained proactively or set up reactively. There are two approaches to this, which this paper dubs the \emph{route-centered} and the \emph{area-centered} approach repectively.\\

The \emph{route-centered} approach serves networks in which some nodes, near or far, are more important than others. This is illustrated by fig. \ref{fig:rc_img}, which shows the different lamps of a house and the house's control center. Each lamp needs a stable connection to this control center, be it to switch on/off occasionally to confuse burglars, or exchange status info and configurations. Thus, this connection is maintained proactively, as indicated in the diagram by the thick straight line. Additionally, they may want to communicate with each other upon user interaction. Because this happens spontaneously and sparsely, the connections amongst all lamps are set up reactively, as indicated by the dotted lines.\\
Protocols with an \emph{area-centered} approach assume all nodes are equal in principle, but nearby nodes are both more important than nodes which are farther away and know their neighborhood best. They cluster the network into so-called ``routing zones''. Nodes that are in the same zone maintain their connections among each other proactively, and routes towards nodes from foreign zones are established reactively. \todo{write about intra-zone routing, border nodes etc}
One example application for this may be a warehouse as illustrated in \ref{fig:ac_img} whose goods (or their packaging) are equipped with IoT hardware. Employees are thus able to tell details about the stock simply by asking their scanner, which communicated with the other IoT devices. In case a truckload of new goods arrives, \todo{write less fussy}

\subsection{Architecture}
\label{subsec:architecture}
%==============================================================================
Because hybrid protocols incorporate proactive and reactive protocols as building blocks, their design in terms of architecture-- how it all goes together-- may be more than just a sequence of instructions.
\todo{gibt es uberhaupt ``pure'' frameworks?}
- flexibility, esp. as IoT is relatively new \& broad
- lightweightness

\section{Experimental work}
\label{sec:experiments}
%==============================================================================
Most research concerning hybrid routing protocols stems from a time where large testbeds were not very feasible and simulations were conducted instead. \todo{sources, examples} Thus, publications documenting real-world experience with hybrid deployments are rare.\\

\cite{gomez_NSTAODV_eval} has evaluated the reactive AODVv2 protocol for IEEE 802.15.4. networks, a technology widely used in IoT deployments, as early as in 2006. However, the ``real environment'' used consists of 4-7 nodes, arranged in different topologies with a per-node distance of 12 cm. While a careful evaluation of simplified topologies is invaluable when examining new approaches, these findings can not provide us with information on the performance of (NST-)AODV in large scale, production IoT deployments.
\cite{baccelli_p2p_prl} reports about testbed experiences with P2P-RPL, comparing its performance in comparison to pure RPL in terms of route length and percentage of routes traversing the root node.
\cite{WARP} Also compares itself to OLSR in experiments with ``real'' network, but is pretty old and uses 14 laptops \todo{elaborate}\\

While simulations have proven to be useful for protocol design and evaluation, there are two main problems to a simulation-based approach: \todo{find a source for this. STAT.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A simulation is only as good as its model. Without data from ``real world'' experiments, verifying that a model represents real conditions satisfactorily is hard.\todo{impossible is too harsh, non?}
\item Even when the model is adequately accurate, it can never account for the unforeseen quirks which will be encountered in a real environment. Especially in wireless networking, a node's environment (i.e. flying bids, surfaces reflecting differently based on time or weather conditions, unforeseeable radio propagation...) is a big and unforeseeable influence.
\end{enumerate}
In conclusion, experiences from real-world experiments or deployments are vital to fully understand the challenges of hybrid IoT routing and assess the solutions at hand. Because the opportunity to deploy experimental software on productive systems is rarely given, more and more testbeds have been established in recent years. \todo{list examples: DES-Testbed, IoT-Lab, what else?}
The IoT-Lab\footnote{\url{https://www.iot-lab.info}} was created specifically for experiments revolving around the IoT. It gives access to 2728 wireless sensor nodes located at 6 different sites, which can be bonded\todo{fnd better word} to form a seamless network.\todo{Toll, und jetzt?}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%==============================================================================
translate old shit. Framework good, protocol bad. scope depends on deployment. framework may be able to accommodate that too. simulations mostly suck. real-world experiences are rare. hooray for testbeds!

\section{Outlook}
\label{sec:outlook}
%==============================================================================
figure out ways to slim down frameworks.
get real-world experiences. verify vermutungen oder auch nicht. so much to do!
