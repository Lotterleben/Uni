# **Hybrid Routing for the IoT:**
## challenges & opportunities

^ 
- AW1: existing; either proactive || reactive 
- new technologies & Use Cases @ IoT have emerged
- with them: new network characteristic
- *example:* Lighting system: central control (proactive); connection between sofa lamp & switch if person is in room (reactive)

^ 
- bring p&a together in hybrid prots this sem 
- -> adapt to changes @ network characteristics
- comes with own set of challenges:
	* when/where to switch
	* coordinate 2 fundamentally different routing approaches
	* most research stems from time where IoT vision didnt exist -> necessary to adjust & advance

#**Next Steps**
![inline fill](./../images/next_steps.pdf)

^
- Goal: survey, possibly highlighting future path
* summarize chall & exp
* adj: pick suitable protocol(s) & maybe propose changes for IoT

#**risks**

^
- looking at a field with few recent publications
- cause *may* not be the absence of use cases, but just no publishable results because hybrid is not solution
- IoT is a young idea, few actual deployments
- or the use cases that we talked about are unrealistic -> invalidate research
