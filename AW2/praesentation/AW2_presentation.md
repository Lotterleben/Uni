# **Hybrid Routing for the IoT**
## challenges & opportunities

^ 
- AW1: existing; either proactive || reactive 
- new technologies & Use Cases @ IoT have emerged
- with them: new network characteristic

---
#       **proactive**         **reactive**
###

^ 
- bring p&a together in hybrid prots this sem 
- -> adapt to changes @ network characteristics
- comes with own set of challenges:
	* when/where to switch
	* coordinate 2 fundamentally different routing approaches
	* most research stems from time where IoT vision didnt exist -> necessary to adjust & advance

# **Quick history lesson**

TODO: insert pictures of 2000 vs 2014 hardware/visions for mobile nodes here
- ZRP etc: 2006 or earlier
- research has stalled since them
- failure or too early? -> too early.

---
# **The time is now** 

^research is 10 years old, BUT!! 
- now we have the building blocks in place
- let's take the old ideas and translate them to 2014+

# **Some fancy headline which introduces that I'm going to talk about concepts now** 
^
- I'm not going to bore you with lists of outdated protocols
- instead, i'm going to talk about concepts that they introduce and use some of them as examples
- comprehensive list can be found at TODO

- Lighting system: central control (proactive); connection between sofa lamp & switch if person is in room (reactive)
- warehouse: truckload needsa to know abt each other, rest of warehouse less relevant

TODO: okay cool, and what's suitable for the IoT now? how do we translate this to the 21st century?
