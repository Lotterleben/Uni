#**Routing protocol evaluation for the IoT**
##challenges and opportunities

Talked *a lot* about routing protocols. Jetzt mal Butter bei die Fische.

this is the hype cycle for emerging technologies

The IoT is at its peak

And soon we'll all realize that the hardware is still too big and too expensive, and that we have no idea what we're doing.

TODO: photoshop new names ^^
- We talk a lot about the IoT, but we don't have much hands-on experience with it, at least when it comes to routing. We need to compare the performance of protocols and see if/where they fail unexpectedly. We used to do this mainly through simulation. but.
- goal: create a life-like experimentation environment and see how different routing protocols perform under different circumstances

---
#**Simulation is great.**
- cheap
- controllable
- reproducible
- scalable

^
- quickly try out ideas,

---
#**Simulation is not enough.**
- unverified models
- unrealistic network behavior

^
- can't model LLN quirkyness which directly impacts protocol operations
- no simulation model is perfect
- can't know if our model is correct without comparison to “real life”

---
#**Testbeds.**

^
- experience “real life” quirks in a controlled (in terms of topology, traffic flow etc) environment

---
#**Preparation.**
TODO less shitty title and fun stuff

Kurz halten, hatten wir schon

#Performance Metrics

^
by what do we measure the efficiency of a protocol?

---
#**Setup & execution.**

^
- chose IoT-Lab testbed because

#Network Model

#Protocols

#Measurements

^
- store ALL the data
- this is what we#re going to measure
